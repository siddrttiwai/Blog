   <p>BySaptarshi Das </p>
   <p>Apr 05, 2023 01:13 PM IST</p>
   <p>Scindia’s comments come in wake of the Congress continuously holding protests against the disqualification of Rahul Gandhi
    Union civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia on Monday made a scathing attack on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleging that the party was playing with the country’s democracy.</p>
    <img src="union.avif">
    <li> <ul> Scindia’s comments come in wake of the Congress continuously holding protests against the disqualification of Gandhi.</ul>

        <ul> “This is now clear that Congress will leave no stone unturned to reach a new low and to play with India’s democracy. They are doing everything to stay politically relevant. This is not a fight for democracy but an individual. Any criticism of this falls short,” Scindia said while addressing media persons.</ul>
        
        <ul> “A special honour is being given to Rahul ji by the Congress. When he went for bail, he took the entire army of leaders. If this is not an attempt to pressure the court, then what is? In the last few days, Rahul Gandhi and the Congress party is putting pressure on the judiciary and how they have threatened it and made his personal legal fight into a democratic legal fight,” Scindia added.</ul></li>

        <li> <ul>Rajya Sabha MP Kapil Sibal took a jab at the BJP government while reacting to reports of NCERT allegedly erasing certain topics of Mughal empire. </ul>
            <ul> Amid the raging controversy over the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) allegedly removing certain portions on Mughal courts from class 12 history textbooks, Rajya Sabha MP Kapil Sibal on Wednesday took a swipe at the BJP government.</ul></li>
            <img src="mughals.jpg">
            <li> <ul> Taking to Twitter, Sibal remarked that the decision was in sync with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ‘Bharat’, where ‘modern Indian history’ begins from 2014. The BJP government came to power at the Centre in 2014.</ul>

               <ul> Referring to reports that some parts of the 2002 Gujarat riots and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) were excluded from the revised editions, the former Congress leader wrote, "NCERT textbooks: Effaced:</ul>

                <p>The paper titled “Projected Shifts in Bird Distribution in India under Climate Change” flagged the impacts of climate change on biodiversity in India
                    As many as 66 to 73% of the 1,091 bird species four Indian researchers studied to understand the impact of climate change were likely to shift to higher elevations or northwards by 2070, according to a paper published in March in peer-reviewed and open-access journal Diversity</p>
                    <img src="birds.avif">
                    <p>In the paper titled “Projected Shifts in Bird Distribution in India under Climate Change”, researchers Arpit Deomurari, Ajay Sharma, Dipankar Ghose, and Randeep Singh flagged the unprecedented impacts of climate change on biodiversity in India. They concluded that 58–59% of the species studied stand to lose a portion of their distribution ranges. The distribution ranges of 41-40% of the species were expected to increase.</p>
                    <p>Deomurari, the lead researcher who is associated with the World Wide Fund for Nature-India, said they used data citizen scientists have collected and developed fine-tuned species distribution models to predict 1,091 terrestrial bird species that would be distributed in India by 2070 on two climatic surfaces (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) using maximum entropy-based species distribution algorithms.

                        The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has chosen Representative Concentration Pathways or RCPs to represent a broad range of climate outcomes.</p>

        <p>A comparison of the new Class 12 political science textbook titled “Politics in India since Independence” with its older version showed that certain references to Mahatma Gandhi have been deleted
            The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has removed from the new Class 12 political science and history textbooks references such as the “dislike of Hindu extremists for Mahatma Gandhi’s pursuit of Hindu-Muslim unity” and banning of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) after his assassination. The Indian Express was the first to report the deletions from the revised textbooks published for the academic year 2023-24.</p>

            </p>
            <p>A comparison of the new Class 12 political science textbook titled “Politics in India since Independence” with its older version showed that a reference to how Gandhi’s “steadfast pursuit of Hindu-Muslim unity provoked Hindu extremists so much that they made several attempts to assassinate Gandhiji” has also been deleted from the sub-topic titled “Mahatma Gandhi’s sacrifice” in the first chapter.

                That Gandhi was “particularly disliked by those who wanted Hindus to take revenge or who wanted India to become a country for the Hindus, just as Pakistan was for Muslims” has also been deleted.
                
                The references to the crackdown on organisations spreading communal hatred, the ban on RSS for some time, and the loss of appeal of communal politics, too, have been removed.
            </p>
            <p>In the Class 12 History textbook titled “Themes in Indian History-3”, a paragraph has been revised in the chapter “Mahatma Gandhi and the Nationalist Movement.”

                The revised paragraph reads, “At his daily prayer meeting on the evening of 30 January, Gandhiji was shot dead by a young man. The assassin, who surrendered afterwards, was Nathuram Godse.”
                
                Earlier, it read: “Gandhiji was shot dead by a young man. The assassin, who surrendered afterwards, was a Brahmin from Pune named Nathuram Godse, the editor of an extremist Hindu newspaper who had denounced Gandhiji as an appeaser of Muslims.”
                
                Despite several attempts, NCERT director Dinesh Prasad Saklani was unavailable for comments.
                
                In June last year, the NCERT rationalised the syllabi of Classes 6 to 12 to reduce the burden on students. Among the changes made was the removal of all references to the 2002 Gujarat riots, Cold War, and Mughal courts, industrial revolution. Some Dalit writers were also dropped from a Class 7 textbook.</p>
